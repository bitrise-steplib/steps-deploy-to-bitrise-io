      description: |
        Specify the directory or file path which will be deployed.
        If the specified path is a directory then every file
        in the directory will be deployed - but only the
        files in the specified directory, sub-directories
        won't be uploaded. For uploading the directory's content
        recursively you should use the *Compress* option
        which will compress the whole directory, with
        every sub-directory included.

        If you specify a file path then only the specified
        file will be deployed.

        If this option is allowed the artifacts
        found in the *Deploy directory* folder will be compressed
        into a single file.

        You can specify a custom name for the ZIP using the *zip_name*
        option - otherwise we're going to use the *Deploy directory* name.

        If this option is turned off the artifacts
        found in the *Deploy directory* folder will be deployed
        separately.
