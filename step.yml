      description: |
        Specify the directory or file path which will be deployed.
        If the specified path is a directory, then every file
        in the specified directory will be deployed, sub-directories, however,
        won't be uploaded. To upload the directory's content
        recursively, you should use the *Compress* option
        which will compress the whole directory, with
        every sub-directory included.

        If you specify a file path, then only the specified
        file will be deployed.

        Your App's user roles you want to notify. Separate the role names with commas.

        * testers
        * developers
        * admins
        * owner
        * everyone

        An example to notify your developers and testers:

        `testers, developers`

        If you want to notify everyone in the app's team, just specify `everyone`.

        If you don't want to notify anyone, set this to `none`.

        will be available with a long and random URL which can be shared
        with others who are not registered on Bitrise.

        **If you disable this option, the `Notify Emails` option will
        be ignored and the `Notify User Roles` users will receive the build's
        URL instead of the public page's URL!**

        You can specify a custom name for the ZIP using the *zip_name*
        option - otherwise we're going to use the *Deploy directory* name.

        If this option is turned off, the artifacts
        found in the *Deploy directory* folder will be deployed
        separately.
