title: "Deploy to Bitrise.io - Apps, Logs, Artifacts"
summary: |-
  Deploys build artifacts to make them available for the user on the build's **APPS & ARTIFACTS** tab. Sends test results to the Test Reports add-on.
description: |-
  The Step collects artifacts from previous Steps in the Workflow and places them in a specified deploy directory or compresses them into a single .zip file in the deploy directory. These artifacts are then available on the **APPS & ARTIFACTS** tab of any given build. For installable artifacts, such as IPAs or APKs, the Step can create a public install page that allows testers to install the app on their devices. You can also use the Step to notify users about the build.

  This Step is required in order to use the Test Reports add-on. It converts the test results to the right format and sends them to the add-on.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Set the value for the Deploy directory of file path. The default is the $BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR environment variable which is exposed by the Bitrise CLI.
  2. Set the **Notify: User Roles** and the **Notify: Emails** inputs to configure notifications for the users. Note that the **Notify: Emails** input is only used if a public install page is created and you must use a Secret to set it.
  3. Optionally, you can create a zip file for all your build artifacts by setting the **Compress the artifacts into one file?** input to `true`. 

  Get a public install page that allows testers to install the app on their devices:

  1. Set the **Enable public page for the App?** input to `true`.
  2. Set the **Compress the artifacts into one file?** input to `false`. If all the contents of the deploy directory are compressed into a single zip file, there won't be a public install page.

  ### Troubleshooting

  If your users did not get notified via email, check the **Enable public page for the App?** input. If it is set to `false`, no email notifications will be sent.

  If you can't find the artifacts on the **APPS & ARTIFACTS** tab, check the **Deploy directory or file path** input. You can use [remote access](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/remote-access/) to check if your artifacts are available at the specified location.

        Specify the directory or file path which will be deployed.
        If the specified path is a directory, then every file
        in the specified directory will be deployed, sub-directories, however,
        won't be uploaded. To upload the directory's content
        recursively, you should use the *Compress* option
        which will compress the whole directory, with
        every sub-directory included.

        If you specify a file path, then only the specified
        file will be deployed.

        An example to notify your developers and testers:
